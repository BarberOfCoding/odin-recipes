    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      When you're craving a comforting bowl of creamy pasta, nothing will cure
      you as fast as carbonara. This pasta dish with Roman origins is a sure
      win, calling for just 5 ingredients (not including salt and oil), and done
      from start to finish in 20 minutes. It's basically a pantry dive -
      spaghetti, bacon, garlic, eggs, and parmesan are all ingredients that are
      easy to have on hand and don't spoil fast. As for the creaminess, it's a
      misnomer that carbonara is made with cream (more below) - the creaminess
      comes from the silky parmesan-egg sauce, and it takes a touch of technique
      to get it right.

      Once you have the technique down, this is a recipe you can basically
      repeat from memory. Until then, check out our tips and enjoy!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>12 oz. spaghetti</li>
      <li>Freshly chopped parsley, for garnish</li>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>8 slices bacon</li>
      <li>Flaky sea salt (optional), for garnish</li>
      <li>etc</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta until al dente
        according to package directions. Reserve 1 cup pasta water before
        draining.
      </li>
      <li>In a medium bowl, whisk eggs and Parmesan until combined.</li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, cook bacon until crispy,
        about 8 minutes. Reserve fat in skillet and transfer slices to a paper
        towel-lined plate to drain. Break into bite-size pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add garlic to skillet and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add
        cooked pasta and toss until fully coated in bacon fat. Remove from heat.
        Pour over egg-and-cheese mixture and stir vigorously until creamy (being
        careful not to scramble eggs). Add pasta water a few tablespoons at a
        time to loosen sauce.
      </li>
      <li>Season generously with salt and pepper and stir in cooked bacon.</li>
      <li>
        Drizzle with oil and garnish with flaky sea salt (if using), Parmesan,
        and parsley before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
