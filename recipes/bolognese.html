    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A good bolognese takes time. The longer you let this meat sauce simmer,
      the better and richer it becomes. Pappardelle is a classic choice for
      bolognese and is often sold as fresh pasta instead of dried. You can of
      course venture to make your own fresh pasta or use your own favorite kind
      of noodles. There are no rules here. Except for one: Top the whole thing
      with lots of fresh Parmesan.
