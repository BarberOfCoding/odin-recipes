    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      We took a couple shortcuts for this recipe by using store-bought marinara
      and boxed pasta sheets. It saves a ton of time without sacrificing any
      flavor. We think it's absolutely perfect as-is, but also understand some
      people are looking to make sauce from scratch. If that's the case for you,
      try out our best homemade spaghetti sauce—simple in ingredients and rich
      in flavor, it'll never let you down.

      Regardless of the route you choose to go down, make sure to follow these
      tips—We've reworked this recipe based on user comments to make it even
      better with more meat, more sauce, and more cheese!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3/4 lb. lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>1 tsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>16 oz. whole milk ricotta</li>
      <li>2 tsp. dried oregano</li>
      <li>etc</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 375º. In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta
        according to package directions until al dente, less 2 minutes. Drain
        and drizzle a bit of olive oil to prevent noodles from sticking
        together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, in a large pot over medium-high heat, heat oil. Cook ground
        beef until no longer pink, breaking up with a wooden spoon. Remove from
        heat and drain fat. Return beef to skillet and add garlic and oregano
        and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper, then add
        marinara and stir until warmed through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine ricotta, 1/4 cup Parmesan, parsley, and egg in a large mixing
        bowl and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large casserole dish, evenly spread a quarter of the meat sauce
        across the bottom of the dish, then top with a single layer of lasagna
        noodles, a layer of ricotta mixture, a single layer of mozzarella, and a
        layer of meat sauce. Repeat layers, topping the last layer of noodles
        with meat sauce, Parmesan, and mozzarella.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover with foil and bake for 15 minutes, then increase temperature to
        400º and bake uncovered for 18 to 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Garnish with parsley before serving.</li>
    </ol>
